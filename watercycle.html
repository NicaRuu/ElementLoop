            <p>The water cycle shows the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is a complex system that includes many different processes. Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow. It describes how water evaporates from the surface of the earth, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into rain or snow in clouds, and falls again to the surface as precipitation.
                The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The cycling of water in and out of the atmosphere is a significant aspect of the weather patterns on Earth.

            <p>EVAPORATION<br /> •	liquid surface water is heated by the sun and evaporates into atmospheric water vapor. Evaporation is the process by which liquid water is heated, causing the molecules to change state from liquid to gaseous water vapor. This part of the water cycle is the most common way for water to re-enter the atmosphere from the surface. Liquid water is heated, often by energy from the sun, and the molecules begin to move faster and faster until they escape as a gas. It occurs when water is heated to the boiling point, or the temperature at which water changes state from liquid to gas. Evaporation can be seen in action, such as steam rising from a boiling pot of water on the stove or from a wet sidewalk on a hot summer day.</p>

        <div class="slides slide3">

            <p>CONDENSATION<br /> •	water vapor molecules come together and cool, forming liquid water. Condensation happens in one of two ways: through saturation or cooling to the dew point. Condensation through saturation occurs when water vapor molecules collect within an air pocket and eventually the pocket of air cannot hold anymore. The molecules, packed so tightly they cannot move, become liquid water. Condensation through cooling to the dew point occurs when water vapor molecules are cooled down to the temperature at which they become liquid. This occurs due to the loss of heat energy that causes the molecules to move slower.</p>

        <div class="slides slide4">

            <p>PRECIPITATION<br /> •	 Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow. It is water released from clouds in the form of rain, freezing rain, sleet, snow, or hail. Precipitation is the main way atmospheric water returns to the surface of the Earth. Most precipitation falls as rain. Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor (reaching 100% relative humidity), so that the water condenses and "precipitates" or falls. </p>

        <div class="slides slide5">

            <p>SUBLIMATION<br /> •	 It is most often used to describe the process of snow and ice changing into water vapor (gas) in the air without first melting into water. Sublimation converts ice directly into water vapor, bypassing the liquid phase. This process only occurs when the temperature is very low or the pressure is extremely high. </p>

        <div class="slides slide6">

            <p>TRANSPIRATION<br /> •	 Transpiration is the biological process that occurs mostly in the day. Water inside of plants is transferred from the plant to the atmosphere as water vapor through numerous individual leave openings. Plants transpire to move nutrients to the upper portion of the plants and to cool the leaves exposed to the sun. It is the process of plants removing water from the soil and expelling it to the atmosphere. The water is extracted by the roots, travels through the plant vascular system, and exits through structures called stomata on the underside of the leaves.</p>

        <div class="slides slide7">

            <p>RUNOFF<br /> •     Runoff is precipitation that does not soak into the soil but instead moves on the Earth's surface toward streams. It is the movement of water over the surface of land, or in some cases through it. The water moves downhill, thanks to gravity, through channels as small as a brook and as large as a river. From here, the water will enter a pond, lake, or ocean.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slides slide8">

            <p>INFILTRATION<br />•	 It is the process of water being absorbed into the ground. Water starts as precipitation, when it hits the ground, it must land in a porous area. This is a soil that has enough air space around the individual grains of soil for water to work its way between them and fill the open spaces. The surface phenomenon is governed by soil surface conditions. Water transfer is related to the porosity of the soil and the permeability of the soil profile.</p>
